# 🚗 Dijkstra Algorithm – Shortest Path Finder

This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. It is often applied in routing and network analysis, such as GPS navigation systems and computer networks.

## ✨ Features  
- Shortest Path Calculation – Finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.  
- Efficiency – Utilizes a priority queue to ensure an efficient solution with a time complexity of \(O(E \log V)\).  
- Graph Representation – Supports both directed and undirected graphs with weighted edges.

## 🛠️ Technologies/Concepts Used  
- Dijkstra's Algorithm – Greedy algorithm for solving shortest path problems.  
- Priority Queue – For efficiently selecting the next node with the smallest tentative distance.  
- Graph Representation – Nodes and edges are represented using adjacency lists.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This implementation is a practical example of how to use Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve real-world problems such as finding the shortest route in a map or minimizing the cost of network data flow. This project aims to demonstrate the algorithm's logic and offer an efficient solution for pathfinding in graphs.
